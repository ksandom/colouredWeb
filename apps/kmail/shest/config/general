# Is a warning a failure?
# Generally it should be. But sometimes you want to know about stuff that isn't optimal, but not breal the build for it. If that's the case for you, this is the setting to change.

# Copy origin directory if testLocation is not "."?
# You will almost want to do keep this set to true. It is useful to set this to false when testing the unit tester. I can't currently think of another use case. But it's here if you need it.
