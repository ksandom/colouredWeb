# Why not block ads?

Web developers, site owners, and content creators in general, can get passionately defensive of their website designs. It's going to be hard enough to get them to buy into a project like this that makes their content look different. Disabling ads on their content would make it pretty much impossible since it would cut off a source of revenue for them.

Pull requests trying to block/hide ads will not be accepted.
