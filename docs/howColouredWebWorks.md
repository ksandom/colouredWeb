# How it works

## Short

ColouredWeb generates a custom CSS that overrides the CSS that websites provide to make the web more useable to people who are sensitive to certain colours.

## Long

Most modern browsers have the ability for the user to specify their own CSS file which can selectively override the formatting on websites. This is an excellent tool for making the web more accessible to people with specific requirements. The challenge is that there is no standard that most websites adhere to which makes it quite time consuming to make a CSS file that works everywhere.

That's where this project comes in. The idea is to make everything at least useable and secondly, most things fairly pretty (prefferably in the author's original flavour, but not at the expense of this project's standards.)

Chrome dropped support for this some time ago. I suggest taking a look at the [Alternatives for browsing](https://github.com/ksandom/colouredWeb#alternatives-for-browsing)
