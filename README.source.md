# colouredWeb

Making the web more accessible to people sensitive to particular colours and shades. An example of this is [Irlen Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irlen_syndrome#Theory)

Historically I used this for generating custom StyleSheets for web browsers, and it worked excellently for years like this.

Now it needs some work to bring it up to the quality I want. But I have recently found it really good for generating custom CSS for other purposes, and my old CSS still works with everything I try it on! (That was a surprise.)

I suggest taking a look in [apps/](https://github.com/ksandom/colouredWeb/tree/master/apps) to see a list of apps where the install is currently automated. More coming soon.

## Alternatives for browsing

### What I recommend, where

* Firefox
  * [Dark background and light text](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-background-light-text/).
  * [Dark reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/).
* Chrome based
  * [Dark reader.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh)
  * [Dark background and light text](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-background-and-light/cdcoopnlkdlmphjpjggdmhohkiklonkh?hl=en) - _OH! I need to try this!_
* Safari
  * [Dark reader](https://darkreader.org/safari). - _I have not used it on this platform._
* Edge
  * [Dark reader](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ifoakfbpdcdoeenechcleahebpibofpc). - _I have not used it on this platform._

### Overview of the plugins

"Dark background and light text" is really fast, and is my first choice. It works really well.

"Dark reader" looks gorgeous, and has some really nice controls for adjusting the look of pages. Some of the controls even apply to videos in pages. There is a performance impact, though. Especially on firefox.

Some sites work better in one or the other. So I typically have firefox and a chrome based browser open at the same time, each for different tasks.

Here is some [interesting discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/9mm9jw/best_dark_extension/) from other people on the topic, including some other plugins that I haven't tried yet.
